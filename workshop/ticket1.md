# Getting MEAN
## An Introduction to API-Centered Application Development with Node.js and MongoDB

## Ticket 1: Install Requirements

As a developer, you'll leverage the following technologies to create a application:

* MongoDB
* ExpressJS
* AngularJS - We'll not leverage this for much during this workshop.
* Node.js

At the end of this ticket, if you've successfully completed the requirements:

* You will have installed MongoDB locally.
 - Test this by typing `mongo` from command line.
* You will have installed Node.js locally.
 - Test this by typing `node` from command line.
* You will have installed the Node Package Manager.
 - Test this by typing `npm` from command line.


### MongoDB

To leverage MongoDB you will need to install the local command line utilities in your development environment.

* [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

You will need to install MongoDB locally so that you have access to the local command line utilities.

While you can certainly run MongoDB locally - you'll also be interested to know that you can run MongoDB in the cloud, for free using [MongoDB Atlas](http://mongodb.com/atlas).

### Node.js

Here's the abbreviated guide, highlighting the major steps:

1. Go to the [Node.js Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. Download Node.js for macOS by clicking the "Macintosh Installer" option
1. Run the downloaded Node.js .pkg Installer
1. Run the installer, including accepting the license, selecting the destination, and authenticating for the install.
1. You're finished! To ensure Node.js has been installed, run `node -v` in your terminal - you should get something like v8.3.0

### Node Package Manager (npm)

Node.js ships with a version of `npm` - the Node Package Manager.  This may (or may not) be the latest, greatest version of `npm` and we should update that right out of the gate.

To update `npm` type the following from command line:
```
sudo npm install npm --global // Update the `npm` CLI client
```
