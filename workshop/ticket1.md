# Getting MEAN
## An Introduction to API-Centered Application Development with Node.js and MongoDB

## Ticket 1: Install Requirements

As a developer, you'll leverage the following technologies to create a application:

* MongoDB
* ExpressJS
* AngularJS
* Node.js

### MongoDB

To leverage MongoDB you will need to install the local command line utilities in your development environment.

* [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

You will need to install MongoDB locally so that you have access to the local command line utilities.

While you can certainly run MongoDB locally - you'll also be interested to know that you can run MongoDB in the cloud, for free using [MongoDB Atlas](http://mongodb.com/atlas).
