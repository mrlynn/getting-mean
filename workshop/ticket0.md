# Getting MEAN
## An Introduction to API-Centered Application Development with Node.js and MongoDB

## Ticket 0: Introduction to the Workshop and Tickets

This workshop was created to guide the developer through the process of becoming hero... actually creating an API-centered Application using Node.js and MongoDB.  Well accomplish this through a journey led through by user-centered development tasks called tickets.  This workshop has 15 tickets associated with it and each has a distinct number of tasks required in order to move to the next.

## Structure

The workshop was created using a series of markdown files delivered via the repository [Getting MEAN](http://github.com/mrlynn/getting-mean) - each is called a `ticket`.  Each `ticket` will guide you through the process of several tasks associated with tackling the MEAN Stack.  This repository should be cloned prior to beginning work on the various tickets and tasks.  For help on cloning the repository, see [Cloning a Github Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)

To review the tasks and tickets, drill into the `workshop` directory off of the main repository.  

You may choose to follow along, starting from scratch and reading through, and completing the suggested actions in each ticket.  You may also, if you wish clone the repository to get some of the starting components and examples to accelerate your quest to becoming a hero.

To clone the repository, you'll execute something similar to the following command:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mrlynn/getting-mean.git
```

This will copy all of the files from the repository to your local development environment into a directory (folder) called `getting-mean`.

Once there, you'll see a directory structure similar to the following:

## Concepts

* [User Stories](http://google.com/?q=user%20stories)

    A user story is short, specific and goal oriented.  This workshop will present sections in the form of tickets with individual user stories in them.  You may want to read up on user centric design concepts to become familiar with this as you progress.
